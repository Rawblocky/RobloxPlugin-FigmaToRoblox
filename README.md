# Figma to Roblox

Position out Figma elements onto Roblox Studio! Grab a JSON Converter plugin on Figma, and then enter its code into this plugin. It'll insert all/most of the elements as accurately as possible.

Note that this does not provide a perfect 1:1 replica, rather, it's more of a plugin to position everything out so you don't need to. This plugin also positions/sizes everything in offset, so you may need another plugin to fix that for you.

# Building (Roblox Plugin)

To build the Roblox plugin, make sure you have [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) installed with the folder in this repository opened as the workspace.

You will also need the [Rojo](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=evaera.vscode-rojo) extension installed and enabled.

From there you can press `Ctrl + Shift + B` inside of Visual Studio Code and the plugin should be deployed to Roblox Studio's Plugins folder!
